Can I burn it? - Website brainstorming


Priorities:
1. Show users the relative cost of heating their house by different means, like nottenergycomparison but graphically with a clear and easy to understand UI.

2. For users with a multifuel appliance, show what can be burnt and how economic it is relative to other options

3. Fuel specific hints and tips

4. Show historical trends & monetise with adverts?
